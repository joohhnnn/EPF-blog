Hey my name is joohhnnn. Here is my update on EPF4 Week 6.

## Week 6 Work Summary: 
In-depth Understanding of Taiko and Layer2, and Systematic Review of the Optimism Sequencer Support for ERC 4337 Bundlers Project
## Overview
This week, I delved into the principles behind Taiko and had multiple discussions with the team about Layer2 technologies. Additionally, I completed a systematic review of the [Optimism Sequencer Support for ERC 4337 Bundlers project](https://github.com/joohhnnn/cohort-four/blob/master/projects/Optimism-Sequencer-Support-for-ERC-4337-Bundlers.md).
