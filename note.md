## Introduction
Hi, my name is John Chase (joohhnnn), and I'm excited to participate in EPF as a permissionless participant. Although I currently work as an application-level developer, I am actively transitioning into infrastructure development. I have spent a considerable amount of my free time studying the infrastructure layer, particularly focusing on Geth. I have made some minor contributions through pull requests.

EPF4 is a significant opportunity for me to further develop my skills and knowledge in the infrastructure domain. My goal is to fully immerse myself in infrastructure development and make meaningful contributions to the ecosystem. By participating in EPF4, I hope to showcase my passion and dedication to infrastructure development and eventually secure a **`job`** where I can contribute effectively to the growth and advancement of the infrastructure layer.
