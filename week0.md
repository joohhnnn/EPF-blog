Hey my name is joohhnnn. Here is my update on EPF4 Week 0.

## Detailed understanding of EPF4.
I have read all the introductions about EPF4 available on GitHub. I have also compiled a list of all the tasks, including any unfinished tasks from previous iterations, that I find interesting. I analyzed my current technical skills and identified areas of personal interest for development. After careful consideration, I have selected a task that I believe I can fully address to the best of my abilities.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I missed the first meeting. However, I am fortunate that the meeting was recorded. After reviewing the entire recording, I now have a clearer understanding of EPF4 and its objectives.

## Final selected Task
Before selecting a task, I conducted a self-analysis. Here are my findings:

1. What am I proficient in? 
I have accumulated significant experience in Geth, particularly in the Ethereum Layer (EL). Therefore, it would be ideal for me to choose a task directly related to the EL layer in Geth, as this would allow me to leverage my expertise effectively.
2. What is my career development direction? 
My intention is to join a team related to the Ethereum EL layer or other Layer 2 networks such as Optimism (OP), ZKSync, etc. Ideally, the project I work on should have the potential for quick portability to other chains or broad applications. This would greatly contribute to my career development in the lower layers of blockchain technology.
3. What new technologies do I need to learn? 
I am also interested in Rust and zero-knowledge proofs (zkp). If the new project combines these technologies, it would be even more appealing to me.

After analyzing all the tasks and assessing their suitability for my skills and interests, I have chosen the project that best fits me: [OP sequencer 4337 support](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-four/blob/master/projects/project-ideas.md#by-yoav-weiss). Based on my initial understanding, this task is centered around building on the OPstack, which involves implementing a sequencer. The OPstack itself is based on Geth, and both the sequencer and EIP-4337 are widely used in the current Layer 2 public chain ecosystem. Moreover, there is a possibility of requiring knowledge in Rust and zero-knowledge proofs (zkp) in the future. Considering these factors, I believe that this task perfectly aligns with my requirements and interests.

## Research on this Task
1. Understanding what the [OP network](https://community.optimism.io/docs/protocol/2-rollup-protocol/) and [sequencer](https://community.optimism.io/docs/protocol/#decentralizing-the-sequencer) is all about
2. delved into the details by reading the provided link related to the task. [Discussion about 4337 with sequencer](https://blog.oplabs.co/erc-4337-and-account-abstraction/) anda [new RPC endpoint](https://hackmd.io/Jx1B9GLiQ-eltQe7L0FwzQ?ref=blog.oplabs.co)
3. taken a brief look at the [implementation of EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337?ref=blog.oplabs.co).

## The problems I encountered during Week 0
1. Insufficient understanding of EIP-4337 and the sequencer: I realized that my understanding of EIP-4337 and the sequencer implementation was not deep enough. To address this, I plan to dedicate Week1 and Week2 to thoroughly reading the source code and exploring more detailed articles related to these components.
1. Uncertainty about the current stage of the task: I am unsure about the current status of the selected task. Based on the detailed implementation requirements mentioned in the articles I have come across, it appears to be an ongoing task. To clarify the situation, I need to reach out to my mentor and inquire about the progress. However, I have been unable to contact my mentor thus far, but I will continue trying to reach him in the upcoming days.

## Next week's schedule
In the preliminary understanding this week, there are still many detailed problems. Next week, I will spend time on the detailed understanding of the OP network and sequencer, and only solve the two problems I encountered in week0 as much as possible.

## Ultimate Goal
To complete this task and gain experience in Rust and zero-knowledge proofs (zkp). Additionally, to provide support related to this task for as many projects as possible. The ultimate objective is to transition from being an application-level engineer to an infrastructure-level engineer and secure a position in the infrastructure domain.
